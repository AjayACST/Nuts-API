# Nuts API
Have you ever thought to yourself, man I really wish I had an API for providing images of edible nuts? Well now you do!

## Installation
You can access the API at http://nuts.api.quirky.codes/ or you can run your own instance of it. There is a sample database file included with 55 pictures of nuts.

## Usage
To request all available images of nuts make a GET request to http://nuts.api.quirky.codes/v1/resources/all or to get a specific number go to http://nuts.api.quirky.codes/v1/resources?id={id-number} there are 55 images available so you can only enter a number 1-55
